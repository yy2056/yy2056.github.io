### Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. gem install github-pages This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.

2. Clone down your fork git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes jekyll serve

3. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

4. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
